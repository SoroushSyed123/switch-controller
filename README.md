# Switch controller program

This is a little Python script I wrote for controlling Aruba network switches.

## Current Features

- Can run CLI commands on the switch remotely, and save the textual output.
- Can save the running configuration of the switch to a file.
- Can display a printout of the MAC address to Manufacturer mappings for each port on the switch.
